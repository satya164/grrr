Grrr!
=====

Grrr! is a small tool to generate gresource files.

Why the name? Well, generating gresource files is boring, and it also starts with "gr" :)

## Dependencies

* gjs
* glib-compile-schemas
* gdk-pixbuf-pixdata

## Usage

Just drag and drop files and folders onto the "Grrr!" window and it'll generate the gresource file. It's that simple!

You can set the default file name and prefix path from the menu on the top right.

Happy Grrr...ing!
